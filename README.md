This repository features a variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. For instance, you can explore linked lists to efficiently manage collections of data, stacks to follow a Last In First Out (LIFO) principle for data handling, and queues for First In First Out (FIFO) operations. Additionally, sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and quick sort allow you to rearrange arrays in ascending or descending order. Searching algorithms like linear search and binary search help locate specific elements within datasets, making it easier to retrieve information quickly. For example, you might use a linked list to manage a playlist, a stack to handle web browser history, or quick sort to organize a list of student grades efficiently.
